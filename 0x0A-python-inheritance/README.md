                          Python inheritance:-  is a concept that allows a class to inherit the methods and properties from another class. The class that inherits is called the child class or subclass, and the class that is inherited from is called the parent class or superclass. Inheritance models an is-a relationship between two classes, such as Car is a Vehicle or Cat is an Animal. 

Inheritance can help to reuse and extend existing code without modifying it. Python also supports multiple inheritance, which means a class can inherit from more than one parent class. However, multiple inheritance can also cause some problems, such as the diamond problem or the class explosion problem. 

A possible alternative to multiple inheritance is composition, which models a has-a relationship between two classes, such as Car has an Engine or Person has a Name. Composition can help to create more flexible and modular designs by delegating behavior to other objects instead of inheriting it.
